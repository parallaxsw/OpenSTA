Power Activity Dual-Edge Propagation Tests
==========================================

Test 1: Check default state (should be disabled)
Power activity propagation dual-edge mode: disabled
Signals can toggle only on one edge of the clock (default).

Test 2: Enable dual-edge mode
Power activity propagation dual-edge mode: enabled
Signals can toggle on both posedge and negedge of the clock.

Test 3: Disable dual-edge mode
Power activity propagation dual-edge mode: disabled
Signals can toggle only on one edge of the clock (default).

Test 4: Enable using numeric syntax (1)
Power activity propagation dual-edge mode: enabled
Signals can toggle on both posedge and negedge of the clock.

Test 5: Disable using numeric syntax (0)
Power activity propagation dual-edge mode: disabled
Signals can toggle only on one edge of the clock (default).

Test 6: Enable using boolean syntax (true)
Power activity propagation dual-edge mode: enabled
Signals can toggle on both posedge and negedge of the clock.

Test 7: Disable using boolean syntax (false)
Power activity propagation dual-edge mode: disabled
Signals can toggle only on one edge of the clock (default).

Test 8: Load design and verify mode affects power calculation
